## Development Workflow

### Before Starting New Finance Features

1. **Review this document** to understand current state
2. **Create a game plan** outlining:
   - Specific feature to implement
   - Database schema changes needed (if any)
   - UI components to create/modify
   - Data flow and state management
   - Testing approach
3. **Get user approval** on the game plan before coding
4. **Implement** feature-by-feature with testing

### Code Organization

## Technical Notes

### Data Flow
1. User selects date
2. `useAccountsWithBalances(date)` fetches accounts with latest balance snapshot for that date
3. `useNetWorthSummary(date)` fetches calculated summary metrics
4. User edits balances in input fields (stored in local state)
5. User clicks "Save Balances" to persist via `useSaveBalanceSnapshots()`

### Balance Calculation Logic
- Each account stores balance snapshots by date
- Latest snapshot for selected date is displayed
- Totals are calculated client-side from current state

### Input Formatting
- Type: `text` (not `number`) to allow comma formatting
- Display: Formatted with commas (1,234.56)
- Storage: Numbers stripped of commas before saving

### Current Account Configuration
- **Cash:** Chase, Chase Business, Wells Fargo
- **Investments:** Crypto, Stocks, Car Value
- **Credit Cards:** Amazon CC, AMEX, Apple Card, C1 Quicksilver, C1 Platinum, C1 Savor, Paypal Credit, WF Credit Card, Venmo Credit
- **Personal Loans:** One Main Loan, Best Egg Loan
- **Auto Loans:** Ally Auto Loan
- **Taxes:** Taxes Owed

## Next Steps Discussion Points

Before implementing new features, discuss:

1. **Priority**: Which feature is most important?
2. **Scope**: Full feature or MVP version?
3. **Dependencies**: Does it require new database tables/migrations?
4. **UI/UX**: Mockup or description of desired layout?
5. **Data source**: Manual entry, import, or API integration?

## Questions to Answer Before Building

- Should we add transaction-level tracking or stick with snapshot-based balances?
- Do we need account categories beyond the current subcategories?
- Should budgets be monthly, annual, or custom periods?
- What date range should historical charts display by default?
- Should we support multiple currencies?
- Do we need recurring transaction support?
- How should we handle account additions/removals over time?
