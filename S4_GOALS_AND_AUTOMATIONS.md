## Detailed Automation Specs

### 🔴 PRIORITY 1: Abandoned Cart Intelligence Agent

**Current Process (The Daily Pain):**
1. Check Asana for abandoned cart tasks (created via Zapier from Shopify)
2. For each cart:
   - Look at Shopify to see past orders
   - Analyze what stopped them (shipping cost? product questions?)
   - Check cart value
   - Review your notes for context
3. If cart >$1200 → Call customer
4. If cart <$1200 → Send email (first email automated via n8n)
5. Second follow-up email is NOT automated
6. **Problem:** Energy intensive, context switching, manual research every time

**Proposed Solution: Intelligent Agent with Full Context**
- **Type:** Agent Pipeline + Webhooks + MCPs
- **Implementation:**

  **Sales Dashboard:**
  - [ ] `monthly_sales` (processed sales data)
  - [ ] `ad_spend_sku` (SKU-level ad tracking)
  - [ ] `processing_logs` (data quality tracking)
  - [ ] `products` (SKU master database)
  
  **System:**
  - [ ] `automation_logs` (all automation tracking)
  - [ ] `data_quality_flags` (items needing review)

### MCPs to Configure

## Decision Framework Applied

### When to Use What (Quick Reference)

| If you need to... | Use this | Example for S4 |
|------------------|----------|----------------|
| Repeatable task with consistent format | **Skill** | Ad spend report generation |
| Complex multi-step workflow | **Agent Pipeline** | Lead qualification → routing |
| Connect to external service | **MCP** | Pull data from Google Ads API |
| React to database changes | **Webhook** | New order → fulfillment workflow |
| Ensure command always runs | **Hook** | Auto-format all reports |
| Search/recommend similar items | **Embeddings** | Find similar products by description |

---

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Data quality issues in CentralBOS exports** | High - Bad data in reports | Medium | Add validation agent, confidence scoring, flag anomalies for review |
| **Shopify API rate limits** | Medium - Delayed cart processing | Low | Implement caching, batch requests, use webhooks instead of polling |
| **Missing SKU data in product database** | Medium - Can't categorize ad spend | Medium | Create review queue, manual fallback, build SKU database over time |
| **n8n migration breaks existing workflows** | High - Business disruption | Medium | Run parallel for 2 weeks, keep n8n as backup, gradual cutover |
| **Agent hallucination on customer emails** | High - Bad customer experience | Low | Human review queue for first 50 emails, template validation, confidence scoring |
| **CentralBOS doesn't have API** | Medium - Manual CSV upload still needed | Unknown | Investigate API availability, build CSV upload interface as fallback |
| **Bollards manufacturing delays** | Medium - Marketing ready before product | Medium | Start with planning/research phase, coordinate with manufacturing timeline |
| **Google Ads account suspended** | Critical - Revenue loss | Very Low | Follow best practices, monitor closely, have backup Bing focus |
| **Over-automation reducing human judgment** | Medium - Miss opportunities | Medium | Build review queues for high-value decisions, keep human in loop for >$X decisions |
| **Time spent building vs using existing tools** | Medium - Opportunity cost | Medium | Focus on high-ROI automations first, use existing tools where better fit |

### Risk Response Plan

**Critical Issues:**
1. Halt automation immediately
2. Revert to manual process
3. Debug in staging
4. Don't deploy until verified

**Medium Issues:**
1. Flag for review
2. Continue with fallback
3. Fix in next iteration

**Low Issues:**
1. Log for later
2. Continue normally
3. Bundle fix with other updates

## Questions & Blockers

### Current Questions
1. **Does CentralBOS have an API?** If not, CSV upload via interface acceptable?
2. **What's the current cart recovery rate?** Need baseline to measure improvement
3. **Klaviyo pricing vs alternatives?** When are we switching email providers?
4. **Bollards manufacturing timeline?** When will product be ready for launch?
5. **Current ad spend breakdown:** How much monthly on Google vs Bing?
6. **Review freelancer cost?** To calculate ROI of automation replacement
7. **Most valuable customer segments?** For prioritizing in automated emails
8. **Top abandoned cart objections?** Shipping cost? Product questions? Other?

### Current Blockers
1. **Ad-spend-processor skill on other computer** - Need to upload to GitHub (PRIORITY)
2. **Beginner dashboard not on GitHub** - Need to commit and decide if to build on or start fresh
3. **n8n workflows need documentation** - Before we can migrate, need to document exactly what they do
4. **SKU database not in Supabase yet** - Need to export and upload product catalog
5. **Zapier workflows not documented** - What exactly is happening Shopify → Asana?

### Information Needed
- [ ] Export current SKU/product database
- [ ] Document n8n workflows (screenshots + descriptions)
- [ ] Document Zapier workflows
- [ ] Get sample CentralBOS export CSV
- [ ] Get sample of Asana abandoned cart tasks
- [ ] Gather past Google Ads & Bing Ads CSVs for testing
