# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Review this PRD and create detailed UX/UI specifications for the Personal Dashboard System. Focus on:

1. **Visual Design System** - Expand the dark mode color palette, typography scale, component library (cards, progress bars, buttons, forms) following the modern aesthetic shown in provided screenshots
2. **Information Architecture** - Detail the navigation structure, page layouts, and responsive breakpoints for all 7 main areas
3. **Interaction Patterns** - Specify hover states, click behaviors, real-time update animations, and micro-interactions for progress indicators
4. **Component Specifications** - Design detailed specs for: Task cards, Project/Phase cards, Deep Work timer panel, Review dashboard cards, Business filter buttons
5. **User Flow Wireframes** - Create wireframes for: Morning routine (Review â†’ Daily â†’ Deep Work), Evening planning (Tasks Hub â†’ Daily Schedule), Business project management workflow

Pay special attention to:
- Color-coded business areas (green=Full Stack, purple=Huge Capital, blue=S4, orange=808, pink=Personal, teal=Health, orange=Golf)
- Progress visualization consistency (red/yellow/green gradients, % complete displays, progress bars)
- High information density without visual clutter (mission control aesthetic)
- Quick actions and 1-2 click navigation requirements

Input: This PRD (docs/prd.md) + existing dashboard screenshots

### Architect Prompt

Review this PRD and create comprehensive technical architecture documentation for the Personal Dashboard System. Design:

1. **Database Schema** - Define all tables (tasks, projects, phases, businesses, daily_pages, deep_work_sessions, health_goals, content_items, finance_records, life_items, golf_scores) with columns, types, foreign keys, indexes, and RLS policies
2. **Real-Time Sync Architecture** - Design Supabase real-time subscription patterns for bidirectional task synchronization, conflict resolution strategy (last-write-wins with timestamps), error handling and retry logic
3. **Progress Calculation Engine** - Specify calculation logic for Task â†’ Phase â†’ Project completion percentages, caching/optimization strategy for Review dashboard aggregations, denormalized tables vs. computed views trade-offs
4. **Security Implementation** - Detail RLS policy patterns for all tables, encryption approach for sensitive client data, audit logging architecture, GitHub Actions security check integration
5. **Component Architecture** - Define React component structure, state management approach (Context vs. custom hooks), Supabase client setup, real-time subscription lifecycle management

Critical technical decisions to address:
- Sync conflict resolution when same task edited simultaneously in multiple locations (Epic 1 Story 1.3)
- Database indexing strategy for <100ms query performance with 100+ tasks (Epic 1 Story 1.6)
- Progress calculation performance optimization to avoid n+1 queries (Epic 2)
- Review dashboard sub-2-second load time despite aggregating 7 areas (Epic 5 Story 5.1)
