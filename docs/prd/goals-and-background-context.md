# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Reduce daily planning/status checking overhead from 1-2 hours to <15 minutes (85%+ reduction in cognitive load)
- Successfully deliver on all 3 consulting contracts + advance 2 personal ventures simultaneously
- Ensure zero security breaches across all client projects with sensitive financial data
- Increase learning/implementation time by 7-14 hours/week through cognitive offload
- Enable 1-2 click visibility across all 4 businesses and life areas from central Tasks hub
- Track time allocation to prevent health goal neglect during busy consulting periods
- Generate 5+ high-quality case studies within 12 months to support revenue scaling

### Background Context

Taylor Grassmick currently operates an unsustainable but strategically designed business model: 3 consulting clients (Huge Capital, S4, 808) generating $15K/month serve as "paid education" funding 2 personal ventures (Full Stack AI, Service SaaS) while building AI automation expertise. This creates a time-sensitive opportunity—capturing premium rates during the 12-24 month window before AI automation becomes commoditized.

The core problem is cognitive overhead: managing dozens of active projects across 4 businesses plus health/content/golf/finance areas creates 7-14 hours weekly of mental "remembering what to do" time, reducing execution velocity during the closing opportunity window. The dashboard serves as an "external brain"—centralizing task synchronization, progress visibility, and time allocation tracking—converting cognitive load into execution capacity for high-value learning and implementation.
