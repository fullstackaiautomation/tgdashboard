# Content Library Enhancement PRD

## 1. Intro Project Analysis and Context

### 1.1 Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis

**Current Project State**:
TG Dashboard is a **personal productivity and business management application** built with React 19, TypeScript, Vite, and Supabase. It provides a unified interface to manage daily tasks, business projects across multiple ventures, and personal goals. The Content Library feature already exists as a foundational implementation that allows users to save and categorize online content (videos, articles, social media posts) with basic metadata.

**Primary tech stack**:
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Backend/Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query)
- **Icons**: Lucide React

### 1.2 Available Documentation Analysis

‚úì Tech Stack Documentation (via package.json analysis)
‚úì Source Tree/Architecture (component analysis complete)
‚úì API Documentation (Supabase schema discovered)
‚úì Existing Content Library implementation found at [src/components/ContentLibrary.tsx](src/components/ContentLibrary.tsx)
‚úó Coding Standards (not formalized)
‚úó UX/UI Guidelines (inferred from existing components)

### 1.3 Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**:
- ‚úì **New Feature Addition** (AI-powered link analysis, business tagging, value ratings)
- ‚úì **Major Feature Modification** (Enhanced UI/UX, improved data model)

**Enhancement Description**:
Enhance the existing Content Library with AI-powered content analysis, dashboard area context tagging, advanced filtering, and a refined Pinterest-style visual experience to make it a comprehensive knowledge management system for saving and organizing online learning resources.

**Impact Assessment**:
- ‚úì **Moderate Impact** (enhancements to existing component, database schema modifications, new AI integration)

### 1.4 Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Enable one-click content saving with AI-powered auto-fill of metadata (title, summary, thumbnail)
- Connect content to dashboard areas (businesses + life domains) for contextual organization
- Implement value rating system (1-10) to track content quality post-review
- Create Pinterest-style masonry grid layout for visual browsing
- Improve search and filtering with multi-select dashboard area tags and advanced criteria

**Background Context**:

The Content Library exists as a basic implementation but lacks the sophistication needed for rapid content curation. Currently, users must manually enter all metadata when saving content, which is time-consuming and reduces usage. By adding AI-powered link analysis, the system can auto-populate card details from URLs, making it effortless to save content on-the-go.

Additionally, connecting content to the existing business entities (Full Stack AI, Huge Capital, S4, 808, Service SaaS) plus life areas (Health, Life, Finance, Golf) provides crucial context for organizing learning resources by their application area. The value rating system (1-10) helps prioritize which saved content is worth revisiting or implementing.

## 4. Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### 4.1 Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript 5.9, JavaScript (ES modules)

**Frameworks**:
- React 19.1.1 (with React DOM 19.1.1)
- Vite 7.1.7 (build tool and dev server)

**Database**:
- Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- @supabase/supabase-js 2.58.0

**Infrastructure**:
- GitHub Pages (static hosting)
- Supabase Cloud (backend/database/auth)

**External Dependencies**:
- @tanstack/react-query 5.90.2 (server state management)
- date-fns 4.1.0 (date utilities)
- lucide-react 0.544.0 (icon library)
- TailwindCSS 3.4.1 (styling)

**New Dependency Required**:
- AI Service API (options: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, Anthropic Claude, or specialized web scraping API like Diffbot/Jina AI)

### 4.2 Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**:

Database schema has been updated with the following columns:
- `ai_summary` TEXT - AI-generated content summary
- `dashboard_areas` TEXT[] - Array of business IDs + literal values (Health, Life, Finance, Golf)
- `value_rating` INTEGER (1-10 constraint)
- `source` TEXT - Platform type (Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, etc.)
- `thumbnail_url` TEXT - Image URL
- `creator` TEXT - Author/creator name
- `status` TEXT - Content status
- `priority` TEXT - Priority level
- `is_favorite` BOOLEAN - Favorite flag
- `folder` TEXT - Folder organization
- `saved_at` TIMESTAMPTZ - Save timestamp

**Indexes created:**
- GIN index on dashboard_areas for array filtering
- Index on value_rating for sorting/filtering

**API Integration Strategy**:

Create new API route/service layer for AI content analysis:
- **Recommended**: Supabase Edge Function (keeps API keys secure, serverless)
- **Alternative**: Client-side direct API calls (simpler but exposes rate limits)

Proposed AI service: **Jina AI Reader API** (free tier available) + **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** for summary generation
- Jina AI Reader: Converts URLs to clean markdown (free, fast)
- GPT-4o-mini: Generates summary, extracts metadata (low cost ~$0.15/1M tokens)

**Frontend Integration Strategy**:

Extend existing ContentLibrary component:
- Create new `useAIAnalysis` custom hook for AI API calls
- Add QuickAddModal component alongside existing modals
- Update ContentItem type definition to include new fields
- Enhance filtering logic to support dashboard_areas array filtering
- Add dashboard_areas configuration (fetch businesses from `businesses` table + hardcoded life areas)

**Testing Integration Strategy**:
- Unit tests for AI parsing logic (mock API responses)
- Integration tests for database migrations
- Manual testing for AI accuracy across different URL types
- Error handling tests for AI service failures

### 4.3 Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**:
```
src/
  components/
    ContentLibrary.tsx (existing - enhance)
    content/
      QuickAddModal.tsx (new)
      ContentCard.tsx (new - extract from ContentLibrary)
      DashboardAreaSelector.tsx (new)
      ValueRatingInput.tsx (new)
  hooks/
    useAIAnalysis.ts (new)
    useContentLibrary.ts (new - extract business logic)
  types/
    content.ts (existing - extend)
  lib/
    ai-service.ts (new - AI API client)
supabase/
  migrations/
    add_content_library_enhancements.sql (new)
  functions/
    analyze-content/ (new Edge Function)
```

**Naming Conventions**:
- React components: PascalCase (QuickAddModal.tsx)
- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (useAIAnalysis.ts)
- Types: PascalCase (ContentItem, DashboardArea)
- Database columns: snake_case (ai_summary, dashboard_areas)

**Coding Standards**:
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Functional React components with hooks
- Async/await for API calls with error boundaries
- React Query for server state caching
- TailwindCSS for all styling (no CSS modules)

**Documentation Standards**:
- JSDoc comments for complex functions
- README update for AI service setup
- Migration notes for database schema changes

### 4.4 Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**:
- No changes to existing Vite build process
- Environment variables for AI API keys (VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY, VITE_JINA_API_KEY)
- Supabase Edge Function deployment via CLI

**Deployment Strategy**:
- Database migrations already applied to production
- Frontend builds deploy to GitHub Pages (existing workflow)
- Edge Functions deploy separately to Supabase
- Feature flag for AI functionality (graceful degradation if disabled)

**Monitoring and Logging**:
- Log AI API response times and success rates to browser console (dev)
- Track AI API usage/costs via OpenAI dashboard
- Supabase logs for Edge Function errors
- Error tracking for failed AI analyses (fallback to manual entry)

**Configuration Management**:
- AI API keys stored in Supabase Edge Function secrets (not exposed client-side)
- Dashboard areas configuration pulled from `businesses` table + hardcoded life areas
- Feature flags via environment variables (VITE_ENABLE_AI_FEATURES)

### 4.5 Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- AI extraction accuracy varies by website (some sites block scrapers)
  - *Mitigation*: Fallback to manual entry, support multiple scraping services
- AI API costs could escalate with heavy usage
  - *Mitigation*: Use GPT-4o-mini (cheapest), implement rate limiting, cache results
- Thumbnail storage costs in Supabase
  - *Mitigation*: Compress images, use external URLs when possible, set storage limits

**Integration Risks**:
- Dashboard areas array filtering performance with large datasets
  - *Mitigation*: GIN index on array column, limit initial query results
- React Query cache invalidation complexity with new fields
  - *Mitigation*: Clear cache on schema changes, use query keys consistently

**Deployment Risks**:
- AI service outage breaks content saving
  - *Mitigation*: Graceful fallback to manual mode, retry logic with exponential backoff
- Environment variable misconfiguration in production
  - *Mitigation*: Validation on app startup, clear error messages for missing keys

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Phased rollout**: Deploy AI features behind feature flag, enable for testing first
2. **Comprehensive error handling**: Every AI call wrapped in try/catch with user-friendly messages
3. **Performance monitoring**: Track AI response times, set timeout thresholds
4. **Cost controls**: Implement daily API call limits per user to prevent runaway costs
5. **Data validation**: Validate AI-generated data before saving to database
