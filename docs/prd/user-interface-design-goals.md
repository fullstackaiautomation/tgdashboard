# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Modern dark mode dashboard with vibrant color-coded cards optimized for visual information scanning. Design philosophy: "1-2 click access to everything" using card-based layouts, tabbed navigation, and color psychology for instant business/area recognition. The interface prioritizes visual hierarchy through bold colors, clear typography, and metric-driven cards that provide at-a-glance status.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Card-based information architecture:** Task cards, metric cards, and session cards with color coding by business area (green=Full Stack, purple=Huge Capital, blue=S4, orange=808, pink=Personal, teal=Health, orange=Golf)
- **Tab-based sub-navigation:** To-Do List / Schedule / Deep Work tabs within Daily section for efficient context switching
- **Persistent Deep Work timer:** Right-side panel with prominent countdown timer, task selection, focus area dropdown, and start/stop controls
- **Metric dashboard cards:** Large number displays for Active/Completed/Recurring/Overdue tasks with color-coded status indicators
- **Business area filtering:** Quick filter buttons showing task counts per business with color-coded badges
- **Inline task management:** Expandable task cards with checkboxes, checklists, and "Think Thru" notes sections

### Core Screens and Views

- **Daily To-Do List** (primary view: task metrics, due today/tomorrow cards, business filters, Deep Work timer panel)
- **Daily Schedule** (tabbed view within Daily section)
- **Deep Work Sessions** (analytics view: total sessions, time tracking, business/project breakdown with visual cards)
- **Deep Work Session Log** (detailed log entries with date, time range, duration, business area, labels, and notes in color-coded rows)
- **Tasks Hub** (central synchronization dashboard - to be enhanced)
- **Business Pages** (5 pages: Full Stack AI, Service SaaS, Huge Capital, S4, 808 with Project > Phase > Task hierarchy)
- **Content Library, Health, Finances, Life, Golf pages** (following similar card-based visual patterns)

### Accessibility

**None** - Dark mode only, no accessibility standards required for personal-use dashboard

### Branding

**Dark mode modern aesthetic** with vibrant color palette:
- Background: Dark gray/black (#1a1a1a approximate)
- Primary accent: Orange (#ff8c42 for CTAs, active states)
- Business color coding: Green (Full Stack), Purple (Huge Capital), Blue (S4), Orange (808), Pink/Magenta (Personal), Teal (Health), Orange-red (Golf)
- Typography: Clean sans-serif, bold headers, clear hierarchy
- Visual style: Glass-morphism cards, subtle shadows, rounded corners, modern button styles

High visual impact appropriate for personal productivity and professional enough for client case study screenshots.

### Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive** - Desktop-first dark mode design with mobile-responsive layout. Optimized for desktop/laptop primary usage with graceful adaptation to tablet and mobile screens.
