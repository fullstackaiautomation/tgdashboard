# Checklist Results Report

### PM Checklist Validation Summary

**Overall PRD Completeness:** 92%
**MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right
**Readiness for Architecture Phase:** ✅ **READY**

**Category Pass Rates:**
- Problem Definition & Context: 95% (19/20) ✅
- MVP Scope Definition: 93% (14/15) ✅
- User Experience Requirements: 75% (12/16) ⚠️
- Functional Requirements: 96% (24/25) ✅
- Non-Functional Requirements: 94% (17/18) ✅
- Epic & Story Structure: 97% (29/30) ✅
- Technical Guidance: 92% (16/18) ✅
- Cross-Functional Requirements: 78% (11/14) ⚠️
- Clarity & Communication: 95% (9/10) ✅

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **Strengths:** Clear problem statement with quantified impact (7-14 hours/week cognitive overhead), well-structured 5-epic plan with logical sequencing, comprehensive security requirements addressing sensitive client data risk
- ⚠️ **Minor Gaps:** Explicit user journey flows not documented (acceptable - workflows are implicit in epic stories), data model relationships implied but not diagrammed
- ✅ **Epic Sequencing Validated:** Sync → Progress → Security → Analytics → Review follows agile best practices and dependency order
- ✅ **Story Sizing Appropriate:** Stories scoped for AI agent execution in focused sessions per brief requirements
- ✅ **Technical Constraints Clear:** React + Supabase + GitHub Actions stack locked, brownfield project with no rewrites

**Scope Recommendations:**
- **MVP 1.0 (Core):** Epics 1-3 (Tasks Hub, Progress Viz, Security) deliver primary cognitive offload value
- **MVP 1.1 (Polish):** Epics 4-5 (Analytics, Review Dashboard) add intelligence layer
- **Potential Cut:** Epic 4 could be deferred if timeline pressure - Deep Work timer already tracks time, advanced analytics are enhancement

**Architect Handoff:** ✅ Ready to proceed
