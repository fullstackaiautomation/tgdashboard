# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide - Get Up and Running in 10 Minutes

## Step 1: Run SQL Migrations (5 minutes)

Open your Supabase SQL Editor and run these 3 files **in order**:

### 1. Add Unique Constraints
**File:** `add-unique-task-constraint.sql`
```sql
-- Copy the entire contents of add-unique-task-constraint.sql
-- Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
-- Click "Run"
```
**What it does:** Prevents duplicate tasks in the same phase

---

### 2. Add Foreign Key Constraints
**File:** `add-referential-integrity-constraints.sql`
```sql
-- Copy the entire contents of add-referential-integrity-constraints.sql
-- Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
-- Click "Run"
```
**What it does:** Prevents orphaned tasks, maintains data integrity

---

### 3. Seed Sample Data
**File:** `seed-sample-data.sql`
```sql
-- Copy the entire contents of seed-sample-data.sql
-- Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
-- Click "Run"
```
**What it does:** Creates test businesses, projects, phases, and 15 sample tasks

**Expected Result:**
```
Businesses: 4
Projects: 5
Phases: 11
Tasks (Business): 15
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No tasks showing in Tasks Hub"
- Make sure you ran `copy-tasks-from-tg-to-do-list.sql` earlier
- Check that `seed-sample-data.sql` ran successfully
- Refresh your browser

### "Business Dashboard is empty"
- Make sure you ran `seed-sample-data.sql`
- Select a business from the dropdown
- Refresh your browser

### "Sync not working"
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Look for `[Real-time]` logs
- Make sure you're logged in to Supabase
- Refresh both tabs

### "Can't create duplicate task"
- This is expected! Unique constraints are working
- Try creating a task with a different name
- Or create it in a different phase
