# Story 1.2: Bidirectional Sync - Business Projects to Tasks Hub

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** consultant managing multiple client projects,
**I want** tasks created in Business project pages to automatically appear in the Tasks hub,
**so that** I don't have to manually duplicate tasks between project management and daily planning views.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When a task is created within a Business project (e.g., Huge Capital > Project X > Phase Y > Task Z), it automatically appears in Tasks hub within 500ms
2. Task updates in Business pages (title change, status change, due date change) sync to Tasks hub in real-time
3. Task deletion in Business pages removes the task from Tasks hub
4. Sync uses Supabase real-time subscriptions (not polling) for efficiency
5. Tasks hub displays Project > Phase hierarchy for business tasks to maintain context
6. No duplicate tasks are created during sync (enforce unique constraints)
7. Sync errors are logged and surfaced to user with clear error messages
8. Tasks created before sync implementation are backfilled into Tasks hub via migration script

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.1:** [Source: docs/stories/1.1.tasks-hub-page-structure.md]
- Tasks Hub page structure is complete with TasksHub.tsx, TaskCard.tsx, TaskFilters.tsx
- Database schema includes tasks table with business_id, project_id, phase_id foreign keys
- useTasks.ts hook exists for fetching tasks with React Query
- TaskCard already has optimistic updates pattern for inline editing
- Real-time sync hook (useRealtimeSync.ts) structure exists but may need enhancement for tasks table

**Key Technical Decisions from 1.1:**
- Using React Query with queryKey: ['tasks'] for all tasks fetching
- Optimistic updates pattern: onMutate → onError (rollback) → onSettled (invalidate)
- Supabase client configured in src/lib/supabase.ts with RLS enabled
- CSS custom properties for business colors already defined in src/styles/theme.css

### Architecture Context

**Tech Stack:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/2-frontend-tech-stack.md]
- Frontend: React 19.1.1 + TypeScript 5.9.3
- State Management: TanStack Query (React Query) 5.90.2 for server state caching
- Backend: Supabase JS 2.58.0 for real-time WebSocket subscriptions
- Date Handling: date-fns 4.1.0 for date formatting

**Project Structure:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/3-project-structure.md]
- Business components in src/components/business/ directory
- Business-related hooks in src/hooks/ (useProjects.ts for project CRUD)
- TypeScript types in src/types/project.ts and src/types/business.ts
- Supabase real-time hook in src/hooks/useRealtimeSync.ts

**Component Standards:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/4-component-standards.md]
- Use FC (FunctionComponent) type for all components
- Props interfaces named {ComponentName}Props
- Event handlers prefixed with `handle` (handleCreateTask, handleDeleteTask)
- Callback props prefixed with `on` (onTaskCreated, onSyncError)

**State Management Pattern:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/5-state-management.md]
- React Query for server state synchronization
- useQuery queryKey structure: ['tasks'] for all tasks, ['tasks', 'business', businessId] for filtered
- useMutation with optimistic updates: onMutate for immediate UI feedback, onError for rollback
- Supabase real-time subscriptions invalidate React Query cache to trigger refetch

**Supabase Real-Time Subscriptions:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/5-state-management.md#supabase-real-time-subscription-hook]
```typescript
const channel = supabase
  .channel('tasks-changes')
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',  // INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'tasks',
    filter: 'user_id=eq.' + userId
  }, (payload) => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['tasks'] });
  })
  .subscribe();
```

**API Integration Patterns:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/6-api-integration.md]
- Direct Supabase client usage (no custom API layer)
- Service layer pattern: Create TaskService.ts with static methods for CRUD operations
- Fetch with relations: `.select('*, projects(name), phases(name), businesses(name, color)')`
- Error handling: Always check `if (error) throw error`, catch in React Query onError

**Performance Requirements:** [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md]
- Task sync latency <500ms (95th percentile performance)
- Real-time subscriptions preferred over polling for efficiency
- Database queries <100ms response time with proper indexing

**Sync Conflict Resolution:** [Source: docs/prd/epic-1-tasks-central-hub-synchronization.md#story-1.3]
- Last-write-wins strategy with timestamp comparison
- Use updated_at timestamp for conflict resolution
- No complex CRDT needed for MVP (future enhancement)

**Security Requirements:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/6-api-integration.md + docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md]
- RLS policies required on all tables
- Filter real-time subscriptions by user_id: `filter: 'user_id=eq.' + userId`
- NEVER bypass RLS in application code
- Validate all user input before database operations

**Database Schema (from Story 1.1):**
- tasks table fields: id, user_id, title, description, status, due_date, business_id, project_id, phase_id, life_area_id, created_at, updated_at
- Foreign keys: business_id → businesses.id, project_id → projects.id, phase_id → phases.id
- Indexes on: business_id, due_date, status, user_id for query performance
- RLS policy: `auth.uid() = user_id`

**Unique Constraint Strategy (AC #6):**
- Add unique index: CREATE UNIQUE INDEX tasks_unique_per_phase ON tasks(title, project_id, phase_id, user_id) WHERE phase_id IS NOT NULL;
- Handle constraint violations in UI with try/catch and user-friendly error messages
- Optionally check for duplicates before INSERT with SELECT query

**File Locations for This Story:**
- Main Business page: src/components/business/BusinessDashboard.tsx
- Project card: src/components/business/ProjectCard.tsx
- Phase card: src/components/business/PhaseCard.tsx
- Task form: src/components/business/TaskForm.tsx
- Projects hook: src/hooks/useProjects.ts (create new)
- Real-time hook: src/hooks/useRealtimeSync.ts (enhance existing)
- Sync logger: src/utils/syncLogger.ts (create new)
- Migration script: backfill-tasks-migration.sql (project root)
- Route: Add to src/App.tsx for /business/:businessId

### Testing

**Testing Strategy:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/9-testing-requirements.md]
Manual testing with convenience methods (no automated test suite)

**Manual Testing Workflow:**
1. Cross-Page Sync: Test in 2+ tabs → Verify real-time updates → Measure sync latency (<500ms)
2. Data Integrity: CRUD operations → Verify with `__test.debug()` → Check for orphaned records
3. Edge Cases: Concurrent edits, duplicate prevention, sync errors, offline/online transitions

**Testing Requirements for This Story:**
1. Verify all 8 acceptance criteria manually
2. Test task creation in Business page → verify appears in Tasks Hub within 500ms
3. Test task update in Business page → verify updates in Tasks Hub in real-time
4. Test task deletion in Business page → verify removed from Tasks Hub
5. Test unique constraint: try creating duplicate task in same phase → verify error message
6. Test sync error handling: disconnect network → attempt operation → verify error notification
7. Test backfill migration: run migration script → verify existing tasks appear correctly
8. Test Project > Phase hierarchy display in TaskCard component
9. Measure sync latency using browser DevTools Performance tab
10. Verify real-time subscription connection status indicator

**Test Helpers to Use:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/9-testing-requirements.md]
- `__test.seedData()` to create test businesses, projects, phases, tasks
- `__test.debug()` to inspect current database state
- `__test.testSync(taskId)` to measure sync latency (create this helper in src/utils/testHelpers.ts)
