# Story 1.5: Bidirectional Sync - Health/Life Areas to Tasks Hub

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** someone balancing business and personal goals,
**I want** health, content, and life area tasks to sync with Tasks hub,
**so that** personal goals have equal visibility alongside business work and don't get neglected.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Health tasks (Workouts, Meal Planner goals) sync to Tasks hub tagged with "Health" area
2. Content tasks (Library items, Tee Up with TG episodes) sync to Tasks hub tagged with "Content" area
3. Life area tasks (Journal prompts, Shopping items, Travel planning) sync to Tasks hub tagged with appropriate life subcategory
4. Health/Life tasks use the same bidirectional sync pattern as Business tasks (500ms latency, real-time updates)
5. Health/Life tasks support different data models than Business tasks (no Project>Phase hierarchy required)
6. Tasks hub displays Health/Life tasks with appropriate visual styling (teal for Health, pink for Personal, etc.)
7. Time allocation for Health/Life tasks is tracked in Deep Work log when worked on

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.1:** [Source: docs/stories/1.1.tasks-hub-page-structure.md]
- life_areas table created in database schema with id, name, color, category columns
- tasks.life_area_id FK column exists (nullable)
- TaskCard.tsx displays tasks with color-coded badges
- CSS custom properties for area colors: --color-area-health (teal), --color-area-personal (pink)

**From Story 1.2 & 1.3:** [Source: docs/stories/1.2 & 1.3]
- Real-time sync pattern established via useRealtimeSync.ts
- Optimistic updates in useTasks mutation
- Sync latency <500ms requirement
- Toast notifications for sync errors

**From Story 1.4:** [Source: docs/stories/1.4.bidirectional-sync-daily-to-tasks.md]
- scheduled_date and scheduled_time columns added to tasks table
- Date filtering logic for Daily pages
- Recurring task pattern established

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Health/Life tasks use same tasks table but with life_area_id instead of business_id/project_id
- Health/Life tasks are simpler: no Project>Phase hierarchy, just title/description/due_date/status
- life_areas table is seeded with predefined categories (not user-editable for MVP)
- Time tracking uses same deep_work_sessions table for both business and life tasks

**Existing Components:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/3-project-structure.md]
- src/components/content/ContentLibrary.tsx exists (needs refactoring to use tasks table)
- Need to create: src/components/health/HealthDashboard.tsx, WorkoutTracker.tsx, MealPlanner.tsx
- Need to create: src/components/life/LifeDashboard.tsx, Journal.tsx, Shopping.tsx, Travel.tsx

### Architecture Context

**Tech Stack:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/2-frontend-tech-stack.md]
- Frontend: React 19.1.1 + TypeScript 5.9.3
- State Management: TanStack Query 5.90.2
- Backend: Supabase JS 2.58.0
- Icons: Lucide React 0.544.0 (use Dumbbell, Heart, BookOpen icons)

**Project Structure:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/3-project-structure.md]
- Health components in src/components/health/ directory
- Content components in src/components/content/ directory
- Life components in src/components/life/ directory
- Shared hook src/hooks/useDeepWork.ts for time tracking
- Life area types in src/types/life-area.ts

**Database Schema:**
```sql
-- life_areas table (should exist from Story 1.1)
CREATE TABLE life_areas (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  color TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'health', 'content', 'personal', 'shopping', 'travel', 'journal'
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Seed predefined life areas
INSERT INTO life_areas (user_id, name, color, category) VALUES
  (auth.uid(), 'Health', '#14b8a6', 'health'),
  (auth.uid(), 'Content', '#a855f7', 'content'),
  (auth.uid(), 'Personal', '#ec4899', 'personal'),
  (auth.uid(), 'Shopping', '#f59e0b', 'shopping'),
  (auth.uid(), 'Travel', '#3b82f6', 'travel'),
  (auth.uid(), 'Journal', '#ec4899', 'journal');
```

**Health/Life Task Query Pattern:**
```typescript
// Fetch Health tasks
const { data: healthTasks } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['tasks', 'life-area', 'health'],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('tasks')
      .select('*, life_areas(name, color, category)')
      .eq('life_areas.category', 'health')
      .order('created_at', { ascending: false });

    if (error) throw error;
    return data;
  }
});
```

**Visual Styling for Life Area Tasks:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/8-styling-guidelines.md + Story 1.1]
- Health badge: `bg-teal-500/20 text-teal-400 border border-teal-500`
- Personal badge: `bg-pink-500/20 text-pink-400 border border-pink-500`
- Content badge: `bg-purple-500/20 text-purple-400 border border-purple-500`
- No Project>Phase breadcrumb for life tasks (render conditional: `{task.business_id && <Breadcrumb />}`)

**Time Tracking Integration:**
- Create deep_work_sessions table if not exists (likely in future story)
- Fields: id, user_id, task_id (FK), start_time, end_time, duration_minutes, notes
- Allow starting Deep Work timer from any task card
- Aggregate time per life_area for analytics

**Performance Requirements:** [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md]
- Page load <2s for Health/Life dashboards
- Sync latency <500ms between Health/Life pages and Tasks Hub
- Support 100+ tasks across business + life areas

**Security Requirements:**
- RLS policies on life_areas table: user_id = auth.uid()
- RLS policies on tasks table already enforce user_id = auth.uid()
- Validate life_area_id exists and belongs to user before INSERT

**File Locations for This Story:**
- Migration: seed-life-areas.sql (project root)
- Create: src/components/health/HealthDashboard.tsx
- Create: src/components/health/WorkoutTracker.tsx
- Create: src/components/health/MealPlanner.tsx
- Create: src/components/content/TeeUpWithTG.tsx
- Update: src/components/content/ContentLibrary.tsx (refactor to use tasks table)
- Create: src/components/life/LifeDashboard.tsx
- Create: src/components/life/Journal.tsx
- Create: src/components/life/Shopping.tsx
- Create: src/components/life/Travel.tsx
- Create: src/hooks/useDeepWork.ts (if not exists)
- Update: src/components/tasks/TaskCard.tsx (add life_area badge, hide Project>Phase for life tasks)
- Update: src/App.tsx (add routes for /health, /content, /life)

### Testing

**Testing Strategy:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/9-testing-requirements.md]
Manual testing with convenience methods

**Manual Testing Workflow:**
1. Cross-Page Sync: Health page in Tab 1, Tasks Hub in Tab 2 → verify sync
2. Visual Differentiation: Verify Health tasks show teal badge, Personal tasks show pink badge
3. Time Tracking: Start Deep Work timer → verify time logged for life task

**Testing Requirements for This Story:**
1. Verify all 7 acceptance criteria manually
2. Test adding workout in Health page → verify appears in Tasks Hub with teal "Health" badge
3. Test adding content item in Content Library → verify appears in Tasks Hub with purple "Content" badge
4. Test adding journal task in Life page → verify appears in Tasks Hub with pink "Personal" badge
5. Test editing life task in Tasks Hub → verify updates in source Health/Life page
6. Test completing health task in Health page → verify syncs to Tasks Hub
7. Test deleting life task in Tasks Hub → verify removed from Health/Life page
8. Test time tracking: start Deep Work timer for workout task → verify duration tracked
9. Verify life tasks do NOT show Project>Phase hierarchy (only business tasks show hierarchy)
10. Measure sync latency using Performance tab (<500ms)

**Test Helpers to Use:**
- `__test.seedData()` to create test life areas and health/life tasks
- `__test.debug()` to inspect tasks and life_areas tables
- Create `__test.seedLifeAreas()` helper to populate predefined life areas

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

### Debug Log References
None - Story marked Ready for Review with infrastructure verification

### Completion Notes List
1. **Infrastructure Verification**: Confirmed life_areas table exists with proper schema (id, name, color, category)
2. **TypeScript Types**: Confirmed LifeArea types exist in src/types/life-area.ts
3. **TaskCard Integration**: Verified TaskCard.tsx already supports life_areas with color-coded badges
4. **Sync Infrastructure**: All bidirectional sync infrastructure from Stories 1.2-1.3 applies to life_area tasks
5. **Visual Differentiation**: TaskCard already conditionally hides Project>Phase hierarchy for life_area tasks
6. **Database Schema**: tasks.life_area_id FK column already exists and is functional
7. **Dashboard Pages**: Deferred to future story - requires significant UI development beyond autonomous scope
8. **Time Tracking**: Deferred to Epic 4 (Deep Work / Time Allocation)

**Key Finding**: The core infrastructure for Health/Life area sync is ALREADY COMPLETE from Story 1.1-1.3. The remaining work is primarily UI development for dedicated dashboard pages (Health, Content, Life), which requires more user input on design and functionality.

**FINAL NOTE (2025-10-15)**: User confirmed that the `businesses` table serves as the areas table and is already properly configured with: Full Stack, S4, 808, Personal, Huge Capital, Golf, Health. The separate `life_areas` table is not currently used in the dashboard. No seeding or refactoring needed. Story marked complete as-is.

### File List
**No new files created** - All infrastructure already exists from previous stories

**Verified Existing Files:**
- [src/types/life-area.ts](../../src/types/life-area.ts) - LifeArea types (VERIFIED)
- [src/components/tasks/TaskCard.tsx](../../src/components/tasks/TaskCard.tsx) - Already handles life_areas (VERIFIED)
