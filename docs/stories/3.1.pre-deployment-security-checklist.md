# Story 3.1: Pre-Deployment Security Checklist Implementation

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** consultant handling sensitive client financial data,
**I want** a mandatory security checklist that must pass before any production deployment,
**so that** I never accidentally expose API keys, credentials, or client data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Security checklist document created in repository at `.ai/security-checklist.md` with all verification steps
2. Checklist includes sections:
   - GitHub secret scanning verification
   - Environment variables audit (no keys in client code)
   - Supabase RLS policy verification
   - API endpoint authentication check
   - Client data encryption at rest verification
   - Deployment configuration review
3. GitHub Actions deployment workflow includes automated security check step that fails build if issues detected
4. Checklist includes Claude Code security audit command that can be run pre-deployment
5. Manual checklist sign-off required before merge to main branch (documented in PR template)
6. Checklist tracks completion date, auditor (you), and findings/remediation actions
7. Failed checklist items block deployment with clear error messages explaining what needs fixing
8. Checklist is versioned and updated as new security requirements emerge

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.1:** [Source: docs/stories/1.1.tasks-hub-page-structure.md]
- Supabase client configured in src/lib/supabase.ts
- RLS policies established on tasks, projects, phases, businesses, life_areas tables
- Environment variables: VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

**From Epic 1 Stories:** [Source: docs/stories/1.2-1.6]
- Real-time sync requires proper authentication headers
- All database tables have user_id field for RLS filtering
- Optimistic updates pattern could expose data if RLS fails

**Key Security Context:**
- This is the FIRST story in Epic 3 - establishes foundation for all security work
- Checklist must be completed BEFORE deploying sensitive client financial data
- GitHub Actions workflow already exists for deployment (needs security step added)
- Repository is private but security hygiene still critical
- Solo developer = you are both developer and security auditor

### Architecture Context

**Tech Stack:** [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md]
- Frontend: React SPA with Vite build
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time)
- Hosting: GitHub Pages with custom domain
- Deployment: GitHub Actions automated pipeline
- Domain: GoDaddy (https://tgdashboard.fullstackaiautomation.com)

**Security Architecture Requirements:** [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md]
- All API keys/secrets in environment variables only (never client-side code)
- Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all database tables
- GitHub secret scanning enabled
- Mandatory pre-deployment security checklist before production pushes
- Client financial data encrypted at rest

**Environment Variable Pattern:**
```typescript
// CORRECT: Environment variable usage
const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseAnonKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;

// INCORRECT: Never hardcode keys
const supabaseUrl = "https://abcdefgh.supabase.co"; // ❌ NEVER DO THIS
const supabaseAnonKey = "eyJhbGc..."; // ❌ NEVER DO THIS

// INCORRECT: Never use service role key in client code
const serviceRoleKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY; // ❌ Bypasses RLS
```

**Security Checklist Structure:**
```markdown
# Pre-Deployment Security Checklist v1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-07
**Purpose:** Mandatory security verification before production deployment

## 1. GitHub Secret Scanning
- [ ] Verify GitHub secret scanning is enabled on repository
- [ ] Check for alerts in Security tab → Secret scanning
- [ ] Run: `git secrets --scan-history` (if installed)
- [ ] **Pass Criteria:** Zero secrets detected in repository history
- [ ] **Remediation:** If secrets found, rotate keys and use git-filter-repo to clean history

## 2. Environment Variables Audit
- [ ] Verify .env file is in .gitignore
- [ ] Verify .env.example exists with placeholders only
- [ ] Check no hardcoded keys: `grep -r "supabase\\.co" src/` returns nothing
- [ ] Verify only VITE_ prefixed env vars in client code
- [ ] **Pass Criteria:** No API keys in src/ directory, .env not committed
- [ ] **Verification Command:** `.ai/scripts/security-check.sh`

## 3. Supabase RLS Policies
[... detailed checklist continues ...]
```

**Automated Security Check Script Pattern:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .ai/scripts/security-check.sh

set -e

echo "🔒 Running Pre-Deployment Security Checks..."

# Check 1: Scan for hardcoded API keys
echo "Checking for hardcoded API keys..."
if grep -r "eyJhbGciOiJI" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "❌ FAIL: Hardcoded Supabase key detected in source code"
    exit 1
fi

# Check 2: Verify .env in .gitignore
if ! grep -q "^\.env$" .gitignore; then
    echo "❌ FAIL: .env not found in .gitignore"
    exit 1
fi

# Check 3: Verify .env.example exists
if [ ! -f .env.example ]; then
    echo "❌ FAIL: .env.example file missing"
    exit 1
fi

# Check 4: Scan for common secret patterns
SECRET_PATTERNS=("password.*=" "secret.*=" "api_key.*=" "private_key")
for pattern in "${SECRET_PATTERNS[@]}"; do
    if grep -ri "$pattern" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "// Example"; then
        echo "❌ FAIL: Potential secret found matching pattern: $pattern"
        exit 1
    fi
done

# Check 5: Verify no service role key in client code
if grep -r "SERVICE_ROLE" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "❌ FAIL: Service role key reference found in client code"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ All security checks passed!"
exit 0
```

**GitHub Actions Integration:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  security-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Security Checklist
        run: |
          chmod +x .ai/scripts/security-check.sh
          ./.ai/scripts/security-check.sh
        continue-on-error: false  # Fail build if security check fails

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      # ... rest of deployment steps
```

**RLS Verification Query Pattern:**
```sql
-- .ai/scripts/verify-rls.sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to verify RLS

SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled,
    (SELECT COUNT(*)
     FROM pg_policies
     WHERE tablename = c.tablename) as policy_count
FROM pg_tables c
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND tablename IN (
    'tasks', 'projects', 'phases', 'businesses',
    'daily_pages', 'deep_work_sessions', 'health_goals',
    'content_items', 'finance_records', 'life_items', 'golf_scores'
  )
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Expected output: All tables should show rls_enabled = true and policy_count >= 1
```

**File Locations:**
- Create: .ai/security-checklist.md (main checklist document)
- Create: .ai/security-checklist-changelog.md (version history)
- Create: .ai/scripts/security-check.sh (automated checks)
- Create: .ai/scripts/verify-rls.sql (RLS verification query)
- Create: .claude/commands/security-audit.md (Claude Code command)
- Create: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md (PR template with security sign-off)
- Update: .github/workflows/deploy.yml (add security check step)
- Update: .gitignore (ensure .env, .env.local, *.key patterns included)

### Testing

**Testing Requirements:** [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md]
Manual testing with systematic verification (no automated test suite per PRD)

**Security Validation Workflow:**
1. **Checklist Document Verification:**
   - Review .ai/security-checklist.md for completeness
   - Verify all 6 main sections present with clear pass/fail criteria
   - Check verification commands are executable and produce expected output

2. **Automated Security Check Testing:**
   - Create test file with hardcoded API key → run security-check.sh → verify fails
   - Remove .env from .gitignore → run security-check.sh → verify fails
   - Delete .env.example → run security-check.sh → verify fails
   - Add service role key reference in code → run security-check.sh → verify fails
   - Clean codebase → run security-check.sh → verify passes with green output

3. **GitHub Actions Integration Testing:**
   - Commit intentional security violation → push to feature branch → verify workflow fails
   - Check GitHub Actions logs show which security check failed
   - Verify workflow annotates PR with security failure details
   - Fix violation → push again → verify workflow passes and deployment proceeds

4. **RLS Verification Testing:**
   - Run verify-rls.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Verify all 11 tables show rls_enabled = true
   - Verify each table has at least 1 policy (policy_count >= 1)
   - Test: temporarily disable RLS on test table → re-run query → verify detected

5. **PR Template Testing:**
   - Create test PR → verify PR template loads with security sign-off section
   - Try to merge without checking security boxes → verify blocked (if branch protection enabled)
   - Complete security sign-off → verify merge allowed

6. **Claude Code Command Testing:**
   - Run `/security-audit` in Claude Code
   - Verify Claude scans codebase for common security issues
   - Verify report generated with findings and recommendations
   - Test with known issue (hardcoded key) → verify Claude detects it

7. **Environment Variables Audit:**
   - Verify .env file exists and is in .gitignore
   - Verify .env.example exists with placeholder values only
   - Run: `git log --all --full-history -- .env` → verify .env never committed
   - Grep source code for API key patterns → verify none found

8. **Deployment Configuration Review:**
   - Visit https://tgdashboard.fullstackaiautomation.com → verify HTTPS (not HTTP)
   - Check browser security indicators (padlock icon)
   - Inspect build output (dist/ folder) → verify no .env or secrets present
   - Review GitHub Actions secrets → verify properly configured and not logged
