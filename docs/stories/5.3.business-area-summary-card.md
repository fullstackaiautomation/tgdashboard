# Story 5.3: Business Area Summary Card

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** consultant managing 5 businesses,
**I want** the Business area card to show aggregate status across all 5 businesses,
**so that** I can identify which businesses need attention without checking each individually.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Business card displays aggregate across all 5 businesses:
   - Total active projects count
   - Overall completion % (average across all business projects)
   - Total active tasks across all businesses
   - Total hours invested this week across all businesses
2. Business card expands to show 5 individual business mini-cards with color coding:
   - Full Stack AI (green): "2 projects, 65% complete, 12h this week"
   - Service SaaS (varies): "1 project, 30% complete, 0h this week" (warning)
   - Huge Capital (purple): "3 projects, 80% complete, 15h this week"
   - S4 (blue): "1 project, 90% complete, 8h this week"
   - 808 (orange): "1 project, 45% complete, 5h this week"
3. Businesses with warnings are flagged: zero hours this week, stalled projects (no activity 7+ days), overdue tasks
4. Quick action: clicking business mini-card navigates to that specific Business page
5. Visual indicator shows which business has most active tasks (needs most attention)
6. Business card shows upcoming deadlines: "Next deadline: Huge Capital deliverable in 3 days"

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create aggregate business metrics query (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create src/hooks/useBusinessAreaSummary.ts hook
  - [ ] Query all 5 businesses: Full Stack AI, Service SaaS, Huge Capital, S4, 808
  - [ ] Calculate total active projects: COUNT(projects WHERE status != 'completed')
  - [ ] Calculate overall completion: AVG(project.progress_percentage) across all businesses
  - [ ] Calculate total active tasks: COUNT(tasks WHERE business_id IN businesses AND progress < 100)
  - [ ] Join with deep_work_sessions for weekly hours per business
  - [ ] Aggregate weekly hours: SUM(duration_minutes) WHERE start_time >= NOW() - 7 days
  - [ ] Optimize with single query using CTEs and GROUP BY business_id
  - [ ] Return BusinessAreaSummary interface with all aggregated metrics

- [ ] Task 2: Build per-business drill-down query (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Query individual business stats: projects, completion %, tasks, hours, warnings
  - [ ] Calculate per business:
    - Active projects count
    - Average project completion %
    - Active tasks count
    - Hours invested this week
    - Days since last activity (MAX(tasks.updated_at))
  - [ ] Detect warnings:
    - Zero hours: hours_this_week = 0
    - Stalled: days_since_activity > 7
    - Overdue tasks: COUNT(tasks WHERE due_date < NOW() AND progress < 100) > 0
  - [ ] Return BusinessDetail[] array with 5 businesses sorted by priority
  - [ ] Priority: businesses with warnings first, then by active task count

- [ ] Task 3: Create expandable BusinessAreaCard component (AC: 2, 4)
  - [ ] Create src/components/review/BusinessAreaCard.tsx
  - [ ] Extend ReviewAreaCard with expansion functionality
  - [ ] Add expand/collapse state using useState
  - [ ] Display aggregate metrics in collapsed state: total projects, avg %, tasks, hours
  - [ ] Add ChevronDown/ChevronUp icon indicating expandable state
  - [ ] Click header → toggle expansion (don't navigate)
  - [ ] Expanded state shows 5 business mini-cards below aggregate
  - [ ] Use AnimatePresence from framer-motion for smooth expand/collapse animation
  - [ ] Prevent card body click from collapsing when clicking mini-cards

- [ ] Task 4: Build BusinessMiniCard component (AC: 2, 4, 5)
  - [ ] Create src/components/review/BusinessMiniCard.tsx
  - [ ] Display business name with color-coded icon/badge
  - [ ] Show "X projects, Y% complete, Zh this week" in compact format
  - [ ] Use business-specific colors: Full Stack (blue), Service SaaS (purple), Huge Capital (green), S4 (teal), 808 (orange)
  - [ ] Add small progress bar showing completion %
  - [ ] Make entire mini-card clickable → navigate to /business/:businessId
  - [ ] Highlight business with most active tasks: larger size or bold border
  - [ ] Show warning icons for zero hours, stalled, overdue conditions
  - [ ] Add hover effect: background color matching business color

- [ ] Task 5: Implement warning detection system (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create src/utils/businessWarnings.ts utility
  - [ ] Warning types:
    - NO_HOURS: hours_this_week = 0 → "No time invested this week ⚠️"
    - STALLED: days_since_activity > 7 → "Stalled X days 🕐"
    - OVERDUE: overdue_task_count > 0 → "Y overdue tasks 🔴"
    - LOW_PROGRESS: completion < 20% AND active_projects > 0 → "Low progress ⚡"
  - [ ] Calculate warning severity: critical (3+ warnings), warning (1-2), normal (0)
  - [ ] Display warning badges on mini-cards with appropriate icons
  - [ ] Aggregate warning count in collapsed view: "2 businesses need attention"
  - [ ] Color-code mini-cards: red border for critical, yellow for warning
  - [ ] Sort businesses by warning severity in expanded view

- [ ] Task 6: Create upcoming deadlines widget (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Query nearest deadline across all business projects
  - [ ] SQL: SELECT project, deadline FROM projects WHERE business_id IN (...) AND deadline >= NOW() ORDER BY deadline LIMIT 1
  - [ ] Display format: "Next deadline: Huge Capital deliverable in 3 days"
  - [ ] Color code urgency:
    - <3 days: red text and icon
    - 3-7 days: yellow text
    - >7 days: gray text
  - [ ] Show project name and business name
  - [ ] Add countdown: "in X days" or "tomorrow" or "today!"
  - [ ] Link to project detail page on click
  - [ ] If no upcoming deadlines: "No upcoming deadlines ✅"

- [ ] Task 7: Highlight most active business (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Calculate active task count per business
  - [ ] Identify business with MAX(active_tasks)
  - [ ] Visual differentiation in mini-card:
    - Larger card size (110% scale)
    - Bold border with business color
    - "Most Active" badge in corner
    - Pulsing animation to draw attention
  - [ ] Display stat: "Huge Capital has 15 active tasks (most)"
  - [ ] Update highlight when task counts change
  - [ ] Handle ties: if multiple businesses tied, show all with badge

- [ ] Task 8: Build aggregate progress visualization (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Display overall business completion % prominently
  - [ ] Use horizontal stacked bar showing 5 businesses proportionally
  - [ ] Each segment colored by business color
  - [ ] Hover over segment → tooltip shows business name and %
  - [ ] Overall % = weighted average by project count
  - [ ] Display total hours this week across all businesses
  - [ ] Show week-over-week comparison: "↑ 5h more than last week"
  - [ ] Add mini trend sparkline showing last 4 weeks of hours

- [ ] Task 9: Implement business navigation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Each business mini-card navigates to /business/:businessId
  - [ ] Pass business context: businessId, businessName, businessColor
  - [ ] Use React Router Link with prefetching for instant navigation
  - [ ] Add keyboard navigation: Tab through mini-cards, Enter to navigate
  - [ ] Show cursor pointer on hover
  - [ ] Add "View Business Dashboard" secondary action for overview
  - [ ] Track analytics: log which businesses users view most frequently
  - [ ] Prevent navigation when clicking warning badges (show details instead)

- [ ] Task 10: Integrate real-time updates (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Subscribe to projects table changes WHERE business_id IN (5 businesses)
  - [ ] Subscribe to tasks table changes for business tasks
  - [ ] Subscribe to deep_work_sessions for weekly hours updates
  - [ ] Update aggregate metrics when any business data changes
  - [ ] Update warning badges when conditions change
  - [ ] Recalculate "most active" highlight when task counts change
  - [ ] Invalidate query cache on project/task completion
  - [ ] Optimistic updates: update mini-card immediately on action
  - [ ] Test: complete project in Tab 1 → verify mini-card updates Tab 2 <500ms

### Testing

**Testing Requirements:** [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md]
Manual testing with systematic verification

**Business Area Card Testing Workflow:**
1. **Aggregate Metrics Accuracy:**
   - Create 2 projects in Full Stack AI, 3 in Huge Capital, 1 each in others
   - Verify card shows "7 total active projects"
   - Set projects to: 65%, 80%, 30%, 90%, 45%
   - Verify overall completion = weighted average (~62%)
   - Create 15 tasks across all businesses
   - Verify shows "15 total active tasks"

2. **Weekly Hours Aggregation:**
   - Log 12h on Full Stack AI this week
   - Log 15h on Huge Capital this week
   - Log 8h on S4, 5h on 808, 0h on Service SaaS
   - Verify card shows "40.0h this week" total
   - Verify individual mini-cards show correct per-business hours

3. **Expand/Collapse Functionality:**
   - Card starts collapsed showing aggregate only
   - Click header → verify expands smoothly with animation
   - Verify shows 5 business mini-cards
   - Click header again → verify collapses smoothly
   - Click "View All Businesses" button → verify expands
   - Verify ChevronDown changes to ChevronUp when expanded

4. **Business Mini-Card Display:**
   - Verify Full Stack AI shows: "2 projects, 65% complete, 12h this week"
   - Verify Service SaaS shows: "1 project, 30% complete, 0h this week"
   - Verify each mini-card has correct color-coded left border
   - Verify progress bar fill matches completion %
   - Click mini-card → verify navigates to /business/:businessId
   - Verify mini-card click doesn't collapse parent card

5. **Warning Detection:**
   - Service SaaS: 0h this week → verify "No hours this week ⚠️" badge
   - Create project in 808 with no activity 10 days → verify "Stalled 10d 🕐"
   - Create 3 overdue tasks in Full Stack AI → verify "3 overdue tasks 🔴"
   - Verify orange border on mini-cards with warnings
   - Verify aggregate shows "2 businesses need attention" (if 2 have warnings)

6. **Most Active Business Highlighting:**
   - Create 15 tasks in Huge Capital (most of any business)
   - Verify Huge Capital mini-card has "Most Active" badge
   - Verify scaled up slightly (110%)
   - Verify purple border instead of normal gray
   - Complete tasks to make S4 most active → verify highlight moves

7. **Next Deadline Widget:**
   - Create project deadline in Huge Capital for 3 days from now
   - Verify shows "Next deadline: Project X (Huge Capital) in 3 days"
   - Create earlier deadline in Full Stack AI (tomorrow)
   - Verify switches to show earliest deadline
   - Set deadline to today → verify red color urgency
   - No deadlines → verify "No upcoming deadlines ✅"

8. **Color Coding Per Business:**
   - Full Stack AI: blue left border
   - Service SaaS: purple left border
   - Huge Capital: green left border
   - S4: teal left border
   - 808: orange left border
   - Verify hover on mini-card intensifies business color

9. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - Open Review Dashboard in Tab 1 and Tab 2
   - Complete project in Huge Capital in Tab 1
   - Verify overall completion % updates in Tab 2 within 500ms
   - Log Deep Work session on Full Stack AI in Tab 1
   - Verify mini-card hours update in Tab 2
   - Create overdue task in Service SaaS in Tab 1
   - Verify warning badge appears in Tab 2

10. **Edge Cases:**
    - No active projects in any business → verify shows "0 projects" gracefully
    - All businesses 100% complete → verify shows green "All complete ✅"
    - Tie for most active (2 businesses with 10 tasks each) → verify both get badge
    - Expand card with 0 projects → verify mini-cards still display with zero stats
    - Delete business → verify aggregate recalculates and mini-card removed
