# Story 1.4: Bidirectional Sync - Daily Pages to Tasks Hub

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** someone who plans the night before,
**I want** tasks assigned to Daily pages (To-Do List, Schedule) to appear in Tasks hub,
**so that** my daily plan and overall task backlog stay synchronized without manual copying.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Tasks added to Daily To-Do List automatically appear in Tasks hub tagged with the specific date
2. Tasks scheduled in Daily Schedule sync to Tasks hub with scheduled time preserved
3. Completing a task in Daily To-Do List marks it complete in Tasks hub (and source Business page if applicable)
4. Tasks can be created directly in Tasks hub and assigned to a specific Daily page via date picker
5. Tasks due "today" or "tomorrow" automatically appear in respective Daily page views (matching existing Due Today/Due Tomorrow cards)
6. Recurring tasks created in Daily pages generate task instances in Tasks hub for each recurrence
7. Daily page displays only tasks relevant to that date; Tasks hub shows all tasks across all dates

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Update tasks database schema for Daily page integration (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Add scheduled_date column to tasks table (nullable, allows scheduling for specific day)
  - [x] Add scheduled_time column to tasks table (nullable, for Daily Schedule integration)
  - [x] Add recurrence_pattern column (enum: 'none', 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly', nullable)
  - [x] Add recurrence_parent_id column (nullable FK to tasks.id for recurring task instances)

  - [x] Run database migration to add columns
- [x] Task 2: Enhance Daily To-Do List to sync tasks with Tasks Hub (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Update src/components/daily/TodoList.tsx to use tasks table instead of local state
  - [x] When task is added to Daily To-Do List, INSERT into tasks table with scheduled_date = current_date
  - [x] Auto-tag tasks with scheduled_date so they appear in Tasks Hub filtered by date
  - [x] When task is completed in Daily To-Do List, UPDATE tasks.status = 'completed'
  - [x] Verify completion syncs to Tasks Hub and Business pages (if task has business_id)
- [x] Task 3: Enhance Daily Schedule to sync tasks with Tasks Hub (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create src/components/daily/Schedule.tsx component for daily schedule view
  - [x] Allow adding tasks to Daily Schedule with scheduled_time (e.g., "9:00 AM - Review PRD")
  - [x] INSERT tasks with both scheduled_date and scheduled_time when added to Schedule
  - [x] Display tasks in time-ordered list in Schedule view

  - [x] Implement date picker using HTML5 input type="date" or date-fns + custom picker
  - [x] Update task with scheduled_date when date is selected
  - [x] Optionally add scheduled_time picker for precise scheduling
  - [x] Verify task appears in Daily page after assignment
- [x] Task 5: Implement automatic Daily page filtering (AC: 5, 7)
  - [x] Update Daily To-Do List query to filter tasks WHERE scheduled_date = current_date OR due_date = current_date
  - [x] Create "Due Today" section: tasks WHERE due_date = CURRENT_DATE
  - [x] Create "Due Tomorrow" section: tasks WHERE due_date = CURRENT_DATE + 1
  - [x] Display only date-relevant tasks in Daily page (hide tasks without scheduled_date/due_date)
  - [x] Tasks Hub shows all tasks regardless of scheduled_date (global view)
- [x] Task 6: Implement recurring task generation (AC: 6)
  - [x] Create src/utils/recurringTasks.ts utility for generating task instances
  - [x] When recurring task is created, set recurrence_pattern ('daily', 'weekly', 'monthly')
  - [x] Generate task instances for next 30 days based on recurrence_pattern
  - [x] Each instance has recurrence_parent_id pointing to parent task
  - [ ] Display recurring task badge in TaskCard with recurrence icon (Deferred - basic utility created)
  - [x] Allow completing individual instances without affecting parent or future instances
- [x] Task 7: Add visual differentiation for Daily tasks in Tasks Hub (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Show calendar icon badge for tasks with scheduled_date
  - [x] Display scheduled_date below task title (e.g., "Scheduled: Oct 7, 2025")
  - [x] Show clock icon and scheduled_time if task has both date and time
  - [ ] Use subtle gray background for scheduled tasks to differentiate from unscheduled backlog (Deferred - badge sufficient)

  - [ ] Schedule task for tomorrow → verify appears in "Due Tomorrow" section
  - [ ] Test multi-tab sync: Daily page in Tab 1, Tasks Hub in Tab 2 → verify updates propagate

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.1:** [Source: docs/stories/1.1.tasks-hub-page-structure.md]
- tasks table schema exists with business_id, project_id, phase_id columns
- TaskCard.tsx displays tasks with color-coding and inline editing
- useTasks.ts hook fetches tasks with React Query
- Tasks Hub has filter functionality for business areas and status

**From Story 1.2 & 1.3:** [Source: docs/stories/1.2.bidirectional-sync-business-to-tasks.md]
- Real-time sync via useRealtimeSync.ts is functional
- Optimistic updates pattern established in useTasks mutation
- Sync latency target: <500ms
- Toast notifications for sync errors implemented

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Daily page tasks use same tasks table (not separate daily_tasks table)
- scheduled_date and due_date are separate: due_date = deadline, scheduled_date = when you plan to work on it
- Recurring tasks use instance model: parent task + instances with recurrence_parent_id FK
- Daily page queries filter by scheduled_date OR due_date to show relevant tasks

**Existing Daily Page Components:** [Source: Story 1.1 Dev Notes + docs/ui-architecture/3-project-structure.md]
- src/components/daily/TodoList.tsx exists (may need refactoring to use tasks table)
- Need to create: src/components/daily/Schedule.tsx for time-based scheduling
- Daily page likely has route /daily in App.tsx

### Architecture Context

**Tech Stack:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/2-frontend-tech-stack.md]
- Frontend: React 19.1.1 + TypeScript 5.9.3
- Date Handling: date-fns 4.1.0 for date formatting and manipulation
- State Management: TanStack Query 5.90.2
- Backend: Supabase JS 2.58.0

**Project Structure:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/3-project-structure.md]
- Daily components in src/components/daily/ directory
- Shared utilities in src/utils/ (recurringTasks.ts for recurrence logic)
- Task types in src/types/task.ts (update to include scheduled_date, scheduled_time, recurrence fields)

**Date Handling with date-fns:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/2-frontend-tech-stack.md]
```typescript
import { format, addDays, isSameDay, isToday, isTomorrow } from 'date-fns';

// Format scheduled date
const formattedDate = format(scheduledDate, 'MMM d, yyyy'); // "Oct 7, 2025"

// Check if task is due today
const isDueToday = isToday(new Date(task.due_date));

// Filter tasks for tomorrow
const tomorrowTasks = tasks.filter(t => isTomorrow(new Date(t.due_date)));
```

**Recurring Task Generation Strategy:**
- Store recurrence pattern on parent task (e.g., recurrence_pattern: 'daily')
- Generate instances on-demand or via scheduled job (cron or Supabase Edge Function)
- Each instance is a separate task row with recurrence_parent_id
- Completing instance doesn't affect parent or other instances
- Alternative: Store only parent task, generate instances in UI (lighter database footprint)

**Database Schema Updates:**
```sql
-- Add columns to tasks table
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN scheduled_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN scheduled_time TIME;
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN recurrence_pattern TEXT CHECK (recurrence_pattern IN ('none', 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly'));
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN recurrence_parent_id UUID REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Add index for date filtering performance
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_scheduled_date ON tasks(scheduled_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_due_date ON tasks(due_date);
```

**Daily Page Query Pattern:**
```typescript
// Fetch tasks for Daily To-Do List (today's tasks)
const { data: todayTasks } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['tasks', 'daily', 'today'],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const today = format(new Date(), 'yyyy-MM-dd');
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('tasks')
      .select('*, businesses(name, color), projects(name), phases(name)')
      .or(`scheduled_date.eq.${today},due_date.eq.${today}`)
      .order('scheduled_time', { ascending: true, nullsFirst: false });

    if (error) throw error;
    return data;
  }
});
```

**Performance Requirements:** [Source: docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md]
- Page load <2s for Daily page with scheduled tasks
- Sync latency <500ms between Daily page and Tasks Hub
- Use indexes on scheduled_date and due_date for fast queries

**Security Requirements:**
- RLS policies on tasks table enforce user_id = auth.uid()
- Validate scheduled_date and scheduled_time are valid before INSERT/UPDATE
- Recurring task instances inherit user_id from parent task

**File Locations for This Story:**
- Migration: add-daily-scheduling-columns.sql (project root)
- Update: src/types/task.ts (add scheduled_date, scheduled_time, recurrence fields)
- Update: src/components/daily/TodoList.tsx (refactor to use tasks table)
- Create: src/components/daily/Schedule.tsx (time-based daily schedule)
- Create: src/utils/recurringTasks.ts (recurring task generation logic)
- Update: src/components/tasks/TaskCard.tsx (show scheduled_date badge)
- Update: src/hooks/useTasks.ts (support date filtering)
- Create: src/components/tasks/DatePicker.tsx (date/time assignment UI)

### Testing

**Testing Strategy:** [Source: docs/ui-architecture/9-testing-requirements.md]
Manual testing with convenience methods

**Manual Testing Workflow:**
1. Cross-Page Sync: Daily page in Tab 1, Tasks Hub in Tab 2 → verify sync
2. Date Filtering: Verify Daily page shows only today's tasks, Tasks Hub shows all
3. Recurring Tasks: Create daily recurring task → verify instances generated

**Testing Requirements for This Story:**
1. Verify all 7 acceptance criteria manually
2. Test adding task in Daily To-Do List → verify appears in Tasks Hub with scheduled_date = today
3. Test adding task in Daily Schedule with time → verify appears in Tasks Hub with scheduled_time
4. Test completing task in Daily To-Do List → verify syncs to Tasks Hub and Business page
5. Test assigning date to task in Tasks Hub → verify appears in Daily page for that date
6. Test "Due Today" filtering: create task with due_date = today → verify appears in Daily page
7. Test "Due Tomorrow" filtering: create task with due_date = tomorrow → verify appears in "Due Tomorrow" section
8. Test recurring task: create daily recurring task → verify 30 instances generated
9. Test completing recurring task instance → verify only that instance is marked complete
10. Measure sync latency using Performance tab

**Test Helpers to Use:**
- `__test.seedData()` to create tasks with various scheduled_date and due_date values
- `__test.debug()` to inspect tasks table after recurrence generation
- Create `__test.generateRecurringTasks(taskId)` helper for testing recurrence logic
