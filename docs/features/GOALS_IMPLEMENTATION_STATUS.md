# Goals & Progress Tracking - Implementation Status

**Date Created**: October 25, 2025
**Current Phase**: 5/7 (Task Integration - In Progress)
**Status**: ✅ Core Foundation Complete

---

## ✅ Completed (Phases 1-4)

### Phase 1: Database Foundation ✅
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251025000000_create_goals_system.sql`

Created 4 tables:
- `goals` - Main goal definitions (area, statement, target date, metrics, status)
- `goal_targets` - Weekly/monthly targets linked to goals
- `goal_task_links` - Bidirectional goal-task associations for auto-sync
- `goal_checkins` - Weekly Sunday check-ins with metrics snapshot

Created PostgreSQL functions:
- `get_goal_progress()` - Calculate goal progress for a date range
- `get_weekly_target_completion()` - Get weekly target completion stats
- `get_sunday_date()` - Helper to get Sunday date for check-ins

RLS policies implemented for all tables.

### Phase 2: TypeScript Types & Hooks ✅
**Files**:
- `src/types/goals.ts` - Complete type definitions
- `src/hooks/useGoals.ts` - CRUD operations & queries

Type definitions:
- `Goal`, `GoalTarget`, `GoalCheckIn`, `GoalTaskLink`
- `GoalArea` (Health | Relationships | Finance | Full Stack | Huge Capital | S4)
- `GoalStatus` (active | achieved | paused | abandoned)
- Input types for mutations

Hooks implemented:
- `useGoals()` - Fetch all goals with filters
- `useGoalDetail()` - Single goal with related data
- `useGoalTargets()` - Fetch targets for a goal
- `useGoalCheckIns()` - Fetch check-ins history
- `usePendingCheckIn()` - Check if Sunday check-in exists
- `useCreateGoal()`, `useUpdateGoal()`, `useDeleteGoal()`
- `useCreateGoalTarget()`, `useUpdateGoalTarget()`, `useDeleteGoalTarget()`
- `useCreateCheckIn()`
- `useLinkTaskToGoal()`, `useUnlinkTaskFromGoal()`

All hooks use React Query for state management and real-time sync.

### Phase 3: UI Components ✅
**Directory**: `src/components/goals/`

Components created:

1. **GoalsView.tsx** (Main container)
   - Area filter bar (Health | Relationships | Finance | Full Stack | Huge Capital | S4 | All)
   - Goal cards grid (responsive)
   - Create goal button
   - GoalForm modal integration

2. **GoalCard.tsx**
   - Summary card with emoji, goal statement, primary metric
   - Progress bar with targets hit/total
   - Target date with countdown
   - Clickable for drill-down

3. **GoalProgressBar.tsx**
   - Visual progress indicator (0-100%)
   - Color-coded: Green (75%+), Yellow (50-74%), Orange (25-49%), Red (<25%)
   - Optional percentage display
   - Size variants (sm, md, lg)

4. **GoalForm.tsx**
   - Create new goal form
   - Fields: area, goal statement, target date, primary metric, metric unit, metric type
   - Form validation
   - Error handling

5. **CheckInModal.tsx**
   - Weekly Sunday check-in modal
   - Shows target metrics progress
   - Overall score calculation
   - 3 reflection questions:
     - "How are you feeling about this week?"
     - "Is this pace sustainable?" (yes/no/adjust)
     - "Any obstacles or wins to note?"
   - Qualitative feedback collection

6. **GoalDetailView.tsx** (Drill-down page)
   - Back navigation
   - Summary cards (metric, date, days remaining)
   - 3 tabs: Overview | Weekly Targets | Check-Ins
   - Overview: Goal summary, check-in button
   - Targets: All targets with add/edit/delete
   - Check-Ins: Historical check-in list
   - Edit/delete goal buttons

### Phase 4: Review Dashboard Integration ✅
**Files**:
- `src/components/review/GoalsAreaCard.tsx` - NEW
- `src/pages/ReviewDashboard.tsx` - MODIFIED

Changes:
- Created `GoalsAreaCard` component for Review dashboard
- Shows total active goals and breakdown by area
- Displays top 3 areas with goal counts
- Integrated into ReviewDashboard grid (always visible)
- Navigation handler for goals route

---

## 🚧 In Progress (Phase 5)

### Phase 5: Task-to-Goal Sync Logic

**What needs to be done**:

1. **Modify `useTasks.ts`**:
   - When task is marked complete, check `goal_task_links` table
   - If task links to a goal target, update progress
   - Trigger React Query invalidation for real-time updates

2. **Update `TaskCard.tsx`** (in tasks components):
   - Show goal badge if task is linked to a goal
   - Display goal and target name on hover/click

3. **Goal Progress Calculation**:
   - Implement real-time progress calculation based on linked task completions
   - Update `GoalCard` to show current weekly progress
   - Handle different contribution types:
     - **Count-based**: Task completion = +1 count
     - **Duration-based**: Sum task duration fields
     - **Metric-based**: Pull from finance module snapshots

4. **Real-time Sync**:
   - Use Supabase real-time subscriptions for instant updates
   - Consider adding `useGoalProgress()` hook for periodic recalculation

## ⏳ Not Yet Started (Phases 6-7)

### Phase 6: Check-In System & Weekly Prompts

**Planned**:
- Sunday notification/reminder in Header
- Auto-calculate targets hit from linked tasks
- Store metric snapshots in check-in
- Generate insights ("You've hit 85% of targets 4 weeks in a row!")
- Monthly trend visualization (sparklines)

### Phase 7: Testing & Polish

**Planned**:
- Seed test data (e.g., Health goal example from PRD)
- Integration testing (task → goal sync)
- Responsive design (mobile/tablet)
- Performance optimization
- Documentation updates

---

## 📝 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Task Hook Integration**:
   - Add goal-task link check in task completion flow
   - Implement progress update mutation

2. **Real-time Sync**:
   - Test task completion → goal progress update
   - Verify sub-500ms latency

3. **Goal Progress Display**:
   - Update GoalCard to show actual weekly progress
   - Calculate from linked task data

4. **Database Push**:
   - Run migration: `supabase db push`
   - Verify tables created in Supabase dashboard

5. **Testing**:
   - Create test goal with targets
   - Create test task linked to goal
   - Verify task completion updates goal progress

## 🔗 Key Integration Points

### Goals ← Tasks (Task-to-Goal)
- Task completion triggers goal progress update
- Real-time subscription for instant UI updates

### Goals ← Finance (Finance-to-Goal)
- Finance goals pull from balance snapshots
- Auto-calculated net worth/savings

### Goals ← Business Projects
- Project goals auto-link to Business Projects
- Phase/task completion feeds into goal progress

## 🛠️ Architecture Notes

### State Management
- React Query for server state
- Component state for form inputs
- Supabase RLS for data access control

### Real-time Sync Strategy
- Supabase real-time subscriptions for goals/check-ins
- React Query invalidation on mutations
- Goal progress calculated from linked tasks on-demand

### Performance Considerations
- Index on user_id, goal_id for fast queries
- Lazy load check-in history (limit 12)
- Paginate goals list if 100+ goals
