# Architecture Summary

This frontend architecture is designed for:

✅ **Rapid Development:** Vite + React + Tailwind for fast iteration
✅ **Type Safety:** TypeScript + Supabase generated types
✅ **Real-Time Sync:** Supabase real-time + React Query optimistic updates
✅ **Security First:** RLS policies, environment variable validation, pre-deployment checklists
✅ **Performance:** <2s page loads, <500ms sync latency, 100+ task support
✅ **Maintainability:** Feature-based structure, consistent patterns, AI-friendly conventions

**Next Steps:**
1. Install React Router (if using): `npm install react-router-dom`
2. Generate Supabase types: `npx supabase gen types typescript`
3. Review security checklist before deployments
4. Use test helpers for rapid manual testing
5. Follow critical coding rules for AI-assisted development
