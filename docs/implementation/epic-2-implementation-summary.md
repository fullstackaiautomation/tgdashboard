# Epic 2: Progress Visualization System - Implementation Summary

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Implementation Date:** January 2025

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive progress tracking system with visual indicators throughout the dashboard. Users can now see task, phase, project, and business-level completion percentages with color-coded progress bars.

## Stories Completed

### Story 2.1: Task-Level Progress Calculation & Display ✅

**Implementation:**
- Added `progress_percentage` column to tasks table (0-100)
- Created `ProgressIndicator` component with 3 states:
  - 0%: Empty circle
  - 1-99%: Progress ring with percentage
  - 100%: Green checkmark
- Created `ProgressSlider` component with slider, numeric input, and quick-set buttons (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Updated `TaskCard.tsx` to display progress indicators and sliders
- Modified overdue logic to use `progress_percentage === 100` instead of status
- Synced task status with progress percentage automatically

**Files Modified:**
- `add-progress-percentage.sql` - Database migration
- `src/components/shared/ProgressIndicator.tsx` - Visual indicator component
- `src/components/shared/ProgressSlider.tsx` - Interactive slider component
- `src/components/tasks/TaskCard.tsx` - Task card with progress display
- `src/types/task.ts` - Added progress_percentage to TaskHub, CreateTaskDTO, UpdateTaskDTO

### Story 2.2: Phase-Level Progress Calculation ✅

**Implementation:**
- Created `usePhaseProgress` hook to calculate average progress from phase tasks
- Created `ProgressBar` component with color gradient (red/yellow/green)
- Updated `PhaseCard.tsx` to display progress bar with task count summary
- Formula: (Sum of task progress_percentage) / (Number of tasks)
- Color coding: <33% red, 33-66% yellow, ≥67% green

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/usePhaseProgress.ts` - Progress calculation hook
- `src/components/shared/ProgressBar.tsx` - Horizontal progress bar component
- `src/components/business/PhaseCard.tsx` - Phase card with progress display

### Story 2.3: Project-Level Progress Calculation & Visualization ✅

**Implementation:**
- Added `progress_percentage` column to projects table
- Created `useProjectProgress` hook with dual calculation modes:
  - With phases: Average of all phase progress percentages
  - Without phases: Direct calculation from tasks
- Updated `ProjectCard.tsx` with prominent progress bar in header
- Added stalled project warning (no activity in 7+ days)
- Automatic last activity tracking

**Files Modified:**
- `add-project-progress.sql` - Database migration
- `src/hooks/useProjectProgress.ts` - Project progress calculation hook
- `src/components/business/ProjectCard.tsx` - Project card with progress display

### Story 2.4: Business Area Progress Dashboard ✅

**Implementation:**
- Created `useBusinessProgress` hook for aggregate business metrics
- Updated `BusinessDashboard.tsx` with metrics header showing:
  - Overall completion percentage
  - Total projects count
  - Active tasks count
  - Completed/total tasks ratio
- Added stalled business warning (no activity in 14+ days)
- Implemented project sorting by completion (least complete first)
- Large progress bar with color coding

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/useBusinessProgress.ts` - Business-level aggregation hook
- `src/components/business/BusinessDashboard.tsx` - Business page with aggregate metrics

### Story 2.5: Daily Goals Progress Tracking ✅

**Implementation:**
- Added daily completion percentage calculation to Daily tab
- Updated "Due Today" card with:
  - Progress percentage
  - Task count summary ("X of Y complete")
  - Color-coded progress bar
- Real-time updates as tasks are completed
- Formula: (Completed tasks today) / (Total tasks for today) × 100

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx` - Daily tab with progress tracking

### Story 2.6: Review Dashboard Progress Aggregation ✅

**Implementation:**
- Created new Review tab in main navigation
- Built unified dashboard with 7 area cards:
  - DAILY: Shows daily completion % with progress bar
  - TASKS: Shows overall task completion %
  - BUSINESS: Expanded card showing all 5 businesses with individual progress bars
  - CONTENT: Navigation to content library
  - HEALTH, FINANCES, LIFE, GOLF: Placeholder cards for future implementation
- One-click navigation to detailed pages
- Color-coded cards matching area themes
- Business card spans 2 columns showing all businesses inline

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx` - Added Review tab and dashboard

## Database Migrations

### Migration 1: Add Task Progress Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS progress_percentage INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ADD CONSTRAINT tasks_progress_percentage_check CHECK (progress_percentage >= 0 AND progress_percentage <= 100);
```

### Migration 2: Add Project Progress Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS progress_percentage INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ADD CONSTRAINT projects_progress_percentage_check CHECK (progress_percentage >= 0 AND progress_percentage <= 100);
```

### Migration 3: Sync Existing Task Data
```sql
UPDATE tasks SET progress_percentage = CASE
  WHEN status = 'Done' THEN 100
  WHEN status = 'In progress' THEN 50
  WHEN status = 'Not started' THEN 0
  ELSE 0
END;
```

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Progress Calculation Strategy:** Used memoized hooks to calculate progress client-side rather than database views for real-time updates
2. **Color Gradient System:** Consistent 3-tier color coding (red/yellow/green) across all levels
3. **Data Sync:** Leveraged existing React Query + real-time subscriptions for automatic updates
4. **Component Reusability:** Created shared ProgressBar, ProgressIndicator, and ProgressSlider components
5. **Business Card Layout:** Made Business card span 2 columns in Review dashboard to show all businesses inline

## Performance Considerations

- All progress calculations use `useMemo` for optimization
- Business progress hook filters and calculates efficiently
- Review dashboard aggregates data from existing queries (no additional DB calls)
- Progress bars use CSS transitions for smooth animations

## Future Enhancements

- Weekly progress trends (comparison to 7-day average)
- Estimated completion dates based on velocity
- Project milestone markers
- Health/Finances/Life/Golf area implementations
- Bulk task completion actions
- Progress history tracking

## Testing Notes

- Tested with 177+ tasks across multiple businesses
- Verified real-time updates across tabs
- Confirmed color coding at all thresholds (0%, 33%, 66%, 100%)
- Validated progress calculations with mixed task states
- Tested stalled warnings with old task data
